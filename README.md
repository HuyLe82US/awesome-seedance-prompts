## 1. Cinematic & VFX
Professional cinematic approaches inspired by renowned directors, designed for high-control **Seedance 2.0** generations with advanced lighting, camera language, and cinematic-grade visual effects.

### 1.1 Islands of Thunder
*Floating rocks spin and fracture mid-tempest as a lone blade carves brief streaks of light—rapid handheld energy, impossible gaps, and a blinding finale that breaks the storm open.*

**Prompt:**

```text
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds
swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a
colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera
hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath
them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain
straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps,
sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera
diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into
the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within
and clears the sky in a blinding flash. 720p 16:9 15 seconds
```

### 1.2 John Woo Style - Bullet Ballet in a Tight Corridor

**Prompt:**

```text
A flooded subterranean megastructure, ancient stone corridors half-submerged in black water,
bioluminescent algae pulsing along the walls like a heartbeat. A masked diver in scarred tactical
gear, lit by a flickering wrist-mounted flare, is pulled downward through collapsing flooded
chambers by the current of a colossal eyeless leviathan moving beneath the floor grates. The camera
plunges after the diver as water rushes through shattering stone archways, air bubbles and debris
spiraling past the lens. The diver grabs a broken pillar to stop herself, the current ripping at her
body, then releases and freefalls through a vertical shaft, twisting to dodge the leviathan's
translucent tendrils whipping upward through the darkness. Quick shaky frames catch her igniting a
harpoon gun mid-fall, the flare illuminating the creature's massive jaw opening below. In the final
movement, the camera spirals downward around her as she fires the harpoon into the creature's mouth,
the bioluminescence erupts blinding white, and the camera bursts through the surface of a vast
underground ocean, the diver silhouetted against the glow of a thousand pulsing organisms on a
cathedral-sized cavern ceiling. 15 seconds.
```

**Prompt:**

```text
A Wuxia-style audiovisual blockbuster. A white-clad swordsman and a straw-caped blademaster face off
in a bamboo forest. The camera slowly pushes in between them, shifting focus between raindrops and
sword hilts. The atmosphere is extremely oppressive; only the sound of rain can be heard. Suddenly,
a crack of thunder flashes, and both charge simultaneously. A fast-panning profile shot captures
their mud-splattering footsteps. The precise moment their weapons clash, the footage switches to
ultra-slow motion, clearly displaying the ring-shaped shockwaves of rainwater blasted away by the
blades, along with bamboo leaves sliced by sword aura. Normal speed resumes as they land
back-to-back. The straw-caped blademaster's bamboo hat splits open, and the scene cuts abruptly.

The following was generated using the prompts from version 1. Video generation: 10-second music
video with beat syncing. 10 seconds, music video with beat syncing, 16:9 or 9:16. Here are 3
different style versions:

Version 1: K-pop girl group - fast cut beat syncing (high-energy stage) Seedance 2.0 Prompts:
10-second K-pop girl group MV beat syncing footage, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps, 8 fast cut shots.

0-1 second: Low-angle shot, four girl group members standing in a triangular formation on the stage
floor, lights flashing with the beat, the stage "seems to vibrate," all members simultaneously
inhale in preparation;

2-3 seconds: Close-up of the lead vocalist in the center, breath and eyes gripping the camera, hair
slightly swaying, background light shifting from cool blue to pinkish-purple;

4-5 seconds: Medium shot of group dance, movements exploding, footsteps starting to enter, all
members simultaneously tossing their hair and turning, movements fluid and graceful;

6-7 seconds: Close-up of hands, gestures causing the fabric to rustle and accessories to jingle,
rings flashing under the lights;

8-9 seconds: Side view of two members, movements more complex, footsteps more frequent, the camera
cuts to the movements, the two members' hands precisely coordinated;

10 seconds: Close-up of the formation, frozen for 0.5 seconds, ending with a final footstep/beat.
Overall: High-saturation neon lights with contrasting warm and cool tones, shallow depth of field
highlighting the movements, no text, logos, or watermarks. ---

Version 2: Ancient Chinese Style - Melodious Flute (Memories and Beats) Seedance 2.0 Prompt:
10-second Chinese style MV beat-matching shot, 9:16 vertical screen, ink painting style.

0-2 seconds: A wide, fixed shot shows a woman in white playing a guqin (a seven-stringed zither)
deep in a bamboo forest, her back to the camera. Smoke rises slowly from the bottom of the
instrument, and the bamboo leaves tremble slightly with the music.

3-4 seconds: The camera zooms in on the woman's profile in slow motion. Her eyelashes flutter, and
she smiles as the strings vibrate under her fingers. The background is blurred.

5-7 seconds: The moment the woman looks up at the camera, the scene cuts in—countless pink petals
fall from the sky. The camera slowly rotates 360 degrees to show the stunning scene of the petals
surrounding her, each petal clearly visible.

8-9 seconds: The camera pulls back to a wide shot. The woman turns to face the camera, her robes
fluttering in the wind. The bamboo forest behind her glows golden in the sunset. She gently touches
the strings of the guqin, and the scene freezes.

10 seconds: The scene gradually transitions to an ink wash effect, finally ending with the lingering
sound of the guqin and the rustling of the bamboo leaves.

--- Version 3: Electronic Music Future Bass·Neon Rainy Night (Cyber ​​Beat) Seedance 2.0 Cue words:
10-second electronic music Future Bass MV beat-matching shot, ultra-wide screen, neon city night
scene.

0-1 second: Fixed shot, neon lights of a rainy city street reflect on the ground, cyberpunk
architecture is reflected in puddles, the rhythm of the scene is slightly jittery in sync with the
low-frequency bass;

2-4 seconds: The camera quickly pushes forward along the street, through the rain curtain, each
raindrop splashing with each bass beat, the camera speed fluctuating with the music rhythm;

5-7 seconds: Cut to the character's perspective, a girl wearing headphones dances in the rain, her
movements perfectly synchronized with the bass—each beat freezes her body for a sense of abruptness,
neon lights create light trails on her body, raindrops shatter in the air from the music;

8-9 seconds: The camera rapidly pulls back and pans upwards, overlooking the entire neon street,
visual ripples of the bass in the rain radiate from the center of the street, each ripple precisely
corresponding to a beat; 10 seconds: The scene freezes at the overhead view, the street scene
instantly reverses to black and white on the last beat and then fades to black, ending with the
aftershocks of the bass and the fading sound of the rain.

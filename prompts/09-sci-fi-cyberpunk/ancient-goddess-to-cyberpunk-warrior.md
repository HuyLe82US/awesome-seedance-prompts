**Prompt:**

```text
[Film Setting] Cinematic quality, IMAX aspect ratio, ARRI Alexa 65mm, high contrast, cyberpunk
aesthetics, 8K resolution. [Core Concept] Time-space folding. From an ancient, pure salt lake
goddess, she instantly awakens into a neon warrior of a futuristic city.

Shot 1: Wide shot, slow push-in. The scene is extremely still. The girl, dressed in red and white
traditional clothing and adorned with silver ornaments, stands on the mirror-like white salt lake.
The sunlight is holy, the background is filled with snow-capped mountains, the wind blows her
clothes, exuding divinity.

Shot 2: Ultra-close-up (ECU), matching editing. The camera rapidly zooms in on the girl's eyes. Her
pupils dilate instantly, reflecting a receding digital stream and blue data light effects.

Shot 3: Jump cut, glitch art interference. The scene is instantly torn apart by intense neon light.
The white salt lake background instantly transforms into a holographic billboard of a cyberpunk city
flashing in the rainy night.

Shot 4: Medium shot, low angle. Visual impact. She is still standing in the center of the frame, but
her traditional robe has become a high-tech reflective functional garment. The original silver
headdress has been replaced by metallic, shimmering headphones.

Shot 5: Close-up, light and shadow shifting. Rain falls on her face, reflecting pink and purple neon
lights. She smiles coldly at the camera, reaches up to put on her goggles, exuding an aura of
dominance.

Shot 6: Wide shot, freeze frame. She stands atop a skyscraper, overlooking the entire steel forest,
with a giant holographic whale swimming behind her. Subtitle: "Awakening · Future". Duration: 10
seconds | Style: Top-tier Hollywood commercial film | Visual Impact: Extremely strong

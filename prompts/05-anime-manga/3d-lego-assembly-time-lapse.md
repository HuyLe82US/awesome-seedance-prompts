**Prompt:**

```text
A boy is diligently assembling LEGO bricks in his room. The scene uses a 3D animation style, with
vibrant colors, smooth lines, and a playful, energetic feel, incorporating time-lapse effects to
showcase the assembly process.

0-3 seconds: A panoramic view of the room; sunlight streams through the window onto the table, where
the boy sits focused on assembling LEGO bricks, his expression serious. The camera slowly zooms in.

3-6 seconds: A time-lapse effect shows the boy quickly assembling the LEGO bricks, the bricks
gradually taking shape in his hands. The camera switches to different angles.

6-9 seconds: A close-up of his hands shows the boy skillfully assembling the LEGO bricks, his
fingers deftly manipulating the bricks. The camera follows the hand movements.

9-12 seconds: The time-lapse effect continues to show the assembly process; the LEGO creation
gradually becomes complete, the boy's expression shifting from focused to satisfied.

12-15 seconds: The boy looks up, a satisfied smile on his face. The camera pulls back to show his
completed LEGO creation.

【Style】 Hyper-realistic cinematic CG, realistic pet documentary feel, warm and healing style,
realistic fur physics simulation, clear details, 8K quality, soft warm color tone, nighttime indoor

nighttime environment, main light off, only the bedside lamp emits a warm yellow glow, the room is
generally dark. There is a blanket on the bed, and two pets are peeking out. 🎞 Storyboard Design
(including shot size + depth of field + lighting logic)

0–3 seconds 【Shot Size】 Medium Shot 【Camera Movement】 Slightly slow zoom in 【Depth of Field】 Shallow
depth of field, blurred background 【Visuals】 A chubby orange cat and an adorable Shiba Inu sit on
the bed, the blankets covering their necks. Each is holding a phone. The phone screens are bright,
the cool light shining on their faces. The bedside lamp emits warm light, contrasting with the cool
light from the phones. The two pets are grinning as they stare at the screens.

3–6 seconds [Shot Type] Close-up [Camera Movement] Slightly handheld [Depth of Field] Very shallow
depth of field [Scene] The orange cat's ears suddenly perk up. Its expression changes from happy to
alert. The phone light flashes on its face.

6–8 seconds [Shot Type] Close-up [Action] The orange cat quickly turns off its phone. The
cool-colored phone light disappears. Only the warm-colored desk lamp remains in the room. The orange
cat crawls into bed, only a small tuft of fur showing.

8–10 seconds [Shot Type] Medium close-up [Action] The orange cat quietly sticks out a small paw from
under the covers and gently pokes the Shiba Inu. The Shiba Inu pauses for a moment. It quickly turns
off its phone. The cool light disappears. It crawls into bed, closes its eyes, and pretends to be
asleep.

10–13 seconds [Shot Type] Long shot from the doorway [Camera Movement] Fixed lens [Depth of Field]
Deep depth of field [Scene] The bedroom door slowly opens a crack. A golden retriever's head peeks
in. Light weakly spills in from the hallway. The golden retriever examines the two dogs on the bed.

13–15 seconds [Shot Type] Close-up of the Golden Retriever [Action] The Golden Retriever nods
contentedly. The door closes gently. The scene returns to the bed, where both pets have their eyes
closed. The Shiba Inu peeks open one eye. Blackout ends. 💡 Key words for generation (suggested to
include): realistic fur simulation subtle breathing movement soft shadow transition warm and cool
light contrast cinematic lighting natural micro expression quiet nighttime ambience cozy bedroom

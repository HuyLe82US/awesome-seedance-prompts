SHOT1 Close-up inside the cockpit, a male driver in his 30s grips the suede steering wheel of a
low-slung race car. He’s focused, sweat on his temple, lit only by blue dashboard LEDs and passing
neon reflections from outside. Tokyo’s city lights flicker across the windshield. Camera slowly
pushes in, locked on his intense gaze through the rearview mirror.

SHOT2 Side profile mid shot, from the passenger seat view. The driver shifts gears with a snap, neon
signage from outside streaks across his face in sharp reflections. The city races by — puddles
splash under the tires. Camera pans with him as he leans forward, eyes narrowing.

SHOT3 Exterior low rear shot, the car’s tail lights flare as he slams the NOS button. Blue flames
erupt from the exhaust. The car launches forward, disappearing into the glowing Tokyo streets.
Camera tracks behind, lights blurring, engine scream echoing in the distance.

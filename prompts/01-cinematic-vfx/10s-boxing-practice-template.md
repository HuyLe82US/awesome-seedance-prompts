```text
Handheld shot circling two boxers practice sparring in a gritty gym, purposefully missing each other
with their swings. Sweat droplets, sharp impacts, breathing intensity. Shallow depth of field,
practical lighting, visceral realism, stable identity. Duration: 10s. Aspect ratio: 16:9. Photoreal
cinematic. Single shot unless specified. Avoid text, captions, watermarks, logos. Stress camera
movement: smooth parallax, consistent objects, stable faces; no text

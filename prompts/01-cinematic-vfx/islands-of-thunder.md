**Prompt:**

```text
A surreal battlefield in the sky: floating rock islands drifting through a thunderstorm, clouds
swirling below like an ocean. The masked ronin dashes across the drifting platforms, pursued by a
colossal winged beast whose chest is a swirling vortex of storm clouds and lightning. The camera
hurtles from island to island, struggling to keep up as rocks tilt, spin, and crumble away beneath
them. Every wingbeat sends shockwaves through the air, shaking the frame and blowing debris and rain
straight into the viewer’s face. Rapid handheld cuts capture the ronin leaping impossible gaps,
sword carving arcs of light that briefly cut through the darkness. The finale shows the camera
diving behind him as he jumps off the last crumbling rock, riding a bolt of lightning directly into
the monster’s chest vortex with a final, all-or-nothing slash that explodes the storm from within
and clears the sky in a blinding flash. 720p 16:9 15 seconds

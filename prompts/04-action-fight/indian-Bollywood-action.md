**Prompt:**

```text
【Style】 An Indian Telugu action blockbuster (Tollywood Action Blockbuster), featuring extremely
exaggerated anti-gravity physics, slow-motion slow motion and fast-slow-motion transitions
(Ramp-mo), dusty scenes, an epic BGM atmosphere, no gore, and a focus on impact. 【Duration】15
seconds 【Scene】A dusty abandoned quarry or construction site, with strong sunlight and a strong
wind. 【Characters】 Protagonist (Hero): With a signature beard, sunglasses, and a denim jacket, he
walks with a confident and domineering air. Opponents (Goons): Dozens of thugs dressed in haphazard
clothes, whose main purpose is to be knocked away. 【Scene Breakdown】

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: The Hero Entry and the Hero's Arrival Visuals: Extremely slow motion (Super
Slow-mo). The protagonist walks slowly, with a whirlwind of yellow sand behind him. Action: He
casually raises his hand and waves it (it doesn't seem to use much force). Special Effects: Just the
palm wind causes the five thugs at the front to fly backward like kites with broken strings, defying
the laws of physics (flying at least 15 meters high), spinning slowly in the air.

[00:05-00:10] Scene 2: Newton's Laws Defied (Physics Defied) Visuals: Fast and slow motion
switching. The protagonist instantly accelerates and rushes into the crowd. Action: The protagonist
delivers a spinning kick. The target hits instantly knocks down ten people behind him, creating a
domino effect. Special Effects: A huge shockwave causes a ring of dust to explode on the ground. All
the thugs, upon contact with the protagonist's fists and feet, are exaggeratedly ejected in all
directions with large amounts of white dust (representing blood), smashing surrounding wooden crates
and props.

[00:10-00:15] Scene 3: The Ultimate Power Move. Scene: The protagonist removes his sunglasses and
gives the camera a wicked smile (Blinking Moment). Action: A jeep rushes towards him. He doesn't
dodge or flinch, but kicks it head-on. Special Effects: The jeep, upon contact with his toes, is
kicked vertically into the air like a toy car, tumbling and scattering parts everywhere. Amidst the
falling car parts and flying thugs in the background, the protagonist calmly puts his sunglasses
back on and fixes his hair.

Action sequence of top-tier fighter pilot doing airborne combat in modern fighter jets. Multiple
shots of ultra-fast and intense aerial combat, switching to close-up profile shots of the pilots'
reactions, their hands doing gear/switch changes, and then back to intense aerial shots. Wind whips
from the fighter jets' wings, and the sounds are intensely loud, showcasing the incredibly intense
and fast-paced action scene which also includes explosions and serious camera shakes along with
fast-moving camera shots. Cinematic quality, 4k, crisp detail, and 24 FPS.

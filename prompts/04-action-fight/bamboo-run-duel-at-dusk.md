**Prompt:**

```text
A Wuxia-style audiovisual blockbuster. A white-clad swordsman and a straw-caped blademaster face off
in a bamboo forest. The camera slowly pushes in between them, shifting focus between raindrops and
sword hilts. The atmosphere is extremely oppressive; only the sound of rain can be heard. Suddenly,
a crack of thunder flashes, and both charge simultaneously. A fast-panning profile shot captures
their mud-splattering footsteps. The precise moment their weapons clash, the footage switches to
ultra-slow motion, clearly displaying the ring-shaped shockwaves of rainwater blasted away by the
blades, along with bamboo leaves sliced by sword aura. Normal speed resumes as they land
back-to-back. The straw-caped blademaster's bamboo hat splits open, and the scene cuts abruptly.

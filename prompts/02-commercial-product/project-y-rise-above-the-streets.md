Brand Y: The Future Has Arrived (15-Second Hollywood Blockbuster Version) Core Creative Concept:
Congested Ground (Real-world Dilemma) -> Mechanical Transformation (Technological Highlights) ->
Vertical Takeoff (Freedom and the Future). Style Setting: High-end Car Commercial. Cyberpunk
futuristic city, cold rainy night, neon lights. 8K ultra-high definition, Transformers-level
mechanical details, and a sense of extreme speed and light.

Storyboard Breakdown:
Scene 1: Ground Dilemma Visual: Close-up. A sleek silver supercar, "Y," is stationary on a
congested, neon-lit rainy night street. Rainwater slides across its smooth paint, reflecting off the
red taillights. Details: The minimalist "Y" logo on the front of the car subtly flashes its
breathing light. Amidst the cacophony of horns, the protagonist (the car) appears calm and elegant.

Scene 2: Mechanical Awakening Visual: Extreme macro close-up. Action: Switching driving modes. A
precise mechanical meshing sound emanated from inside the wheels as the tires flipped downwards 90
degrees, revealing their internal jets. Special Effects: The eerie blue plasma thrusters ignited
instantly, evaporating rainwater from the road into a white mist. Amidst gasps of astonishment, the
car smoothly and vertically levitated.

Scene 3: Soaring into the Future. Visuals: Wide-angle tracking shot. Action: Instant acceleration
from a standstill. The car, shaped like a "Y," transformed into a silver lightning bolt, rising
vertically and speeding through skyscrapers, leaving the red traffic below in its wake. Final frame:
The car flew towards a giant full moon, with a silver metallic 3D logo appearing in the center of
the frame: "Y - Drive the Future."

**Prompt:**

```text
【Style】Mockumentary (Vlog Style), hyperrealism, fixed camera angle, natural lighting, with a touch
of suspense and thriller. 【Duration】15 seconds 【Main Character (Remember to upload reference
image)】A sexy young woman preparing to wash up and go to bed in front of the sink in her bathroom.

[00:00-00:06] Shot 1: Normalcy. Scene: In front of a large mirror in a normal bathroom. Action: The
protagonist is brushing her teeth in front of the mirror, her mouth full of foam. While brushing her
teeth, she makes various funny faces (winking and making faces) in the mirror. Key Detail: At this
moment, the reflection in the mirror is completely normal, and the actions are synchronized.

[00:06-00:11] Shot 2: The Glitch. Action: After brushing her teeth, the protagonist bends down to
spit out the foam, then turns to leave the bathroom. High-Energy Moment (Core Breakthrough): Just as
the protagonist's real body has turned and left the mirror's frame, the "reflection" in the mirror
**doesn't move**! The "reflection" remained in the brushing-teeth pose, even raising an eyebrow at
the camera with a wicked grin, lingering for a full two seconds before suddenly and frantically
"flashing" to catch up with the main body and disappearing. Director's Note: To create an extremely
realistic "network latency" feel, the reflection should have an independent consciousness.

[00:11-00:15] Shot 3: The Punchline. Action: The protagonist, who had already reached the door,
seemed to sense something was wrong and abruptly turned to look at the mirror. Result: The mirror
had now completely returned to normal, empty except for the opposite wall. The protagonist,
bewildered and frightened, looked around the room with a horrified expression. The scene freezes on
the protagonist's bewildered face (horror movie effect).

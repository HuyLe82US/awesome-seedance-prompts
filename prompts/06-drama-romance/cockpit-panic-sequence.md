**Prompt:**
```text
High-intensity action thriller scene, hand-held shaky camera, cinematic motion blur, the woman
storms into the cockpit and freezes as she realizes the pilot seats are empty, warning alarms
flashing red, turbulence shaking the cabin, she sprints forward and straps herself into the
captain’s seat, gripping the controls with determination, sweat on her forehead, quick cuts between
her focused eyes and the shaking dashboard, cut to dramatic exterior aerial shot of the airplane
slicing through storm clouds, lightning illuminating her silhouette inside the cockpit at the
controls, ultra-realistic, dynamic lighting, 4K, immersive sound design, urgent atmosphere.

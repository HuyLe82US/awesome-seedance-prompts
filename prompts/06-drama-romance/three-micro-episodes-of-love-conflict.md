Length: 15 seconds Aspect ratio: 16:9 ---

Version 1: CEO's sadistic love - misunderstanding and breakup (melodramatic) Seedance 2.0 Prompts
15-second modern short drama, luxurious CEO office scene, cool color tone and high-end feel.

0-3 seconds: Medium shot. A young man in a bespoke suit sits in a leather executive chair, his face
cold and his eyes indifferent. A beautiful girl in a white dress stands before him, her eyes red and
brimming with tears. The man speaks, "I gave you a chance," his voice low and cold.

4-8 seconds: The girl's voice trembles, "What chance did you give me? You never trusted me from the
beginning!" She turns to leave, but the man suddenly stands up and grabs her wrist. The camera
follows their struggle, forcing the girl to turn back. They are extremely close, their breaths
mingling. A flicker of hesitation flashes in the girl's eyes, quickly replaced by stubbornness.

9-12 seconds: The man stares into the girl's eyes, his voice low, "So, are you still going to
leave?" The girl bites her lip, "Go...where else can I go?" She cruelly shakes off his hand and
turns to run. The man reaches out to grab her but grasps only air, his hand frozen in mid-air.

13-15 seconds: The camera follows the girl as she rushes out of the office. She wiped away tears in
front of the elevator, but the tears wouldn't stop flowing. As the elevator doors slowly closed, she
crouched down, buried her face in her arms, and sobbed. The final frame of the scene was a close-up
of the elevator numbers dropping from 15, accompanied by a low, sorrowful piano background music.

--- Version Two: School Beauty's Pursuit of Love - A Rainy Confession (Sweet and Heartbreaking
Youth) Seedance 2.0 Prompt: A 15-second modern campus short drama, set in a rainy night classroom
corridor, with a cool blue-toned rainy night atmosphere.

0-3 seconds: Fixed shot. Heavy rain pours outside the classroom, raindrops patter against the
windowpanes. A handsome boy in a white shirt stands in the shadows of the corridor, pacing nervously
back and forth, clutching a pink letter. In the distance, a pretty girl with a high ponytail walks
slowly towards them. The camera shakes slightly with each step she takes to create tension.

4-8 seconds: The girl approaches the boy. He takes a few deep breaths, raises his hand as if to hand
her the letter, then pulls it back. The girl stops in front of him, tilts her head, and smiles, "Did
you need something?" The boy stammers, "I...I..." Before he can finish, the bell rings, startling
them both. The corridor lights flicker. 9-12 seconds: The girl glances at the time, "Class is about
to start, let's talk about it next time," and turns to leave. The boy musters his courage, "Wait!"
He grabs her wrist, and they both freeze. Only the sound of rain and their breathing fills the
corridor. The boy looks down, his cheeks flushed, "This letter." "...Here you go," the girl paused,
looking down at the letter;

13-15 seconds: the camera slowly zooms in on the girl's face, a sweet smile slowly spreading across
her lips, starlight twinkling in her eyes. The final shot freezes on the moment she takes the
letter—a ray of sunlight suddenly streams in through the rain-soaked window, illuminating the two of
them, the scene ending amidst a gentle piano melody and the soft sound of rain. ---

Version Three: Best Friend's Betrayal - Face-to-Face Confrontation (Satisfying Read) Seedance 2.0
Prompt: 15-second modern short drama, upscale restaurant scene, warm gold tones contrasting with a
cold mood.

0-3 seconds: Medium shot, fixed angle. A beautiful girl is celebrating her birthday with friends,
raising a glass and laughing joyfully. Suddenly, the restaurant door is pushed open—her most trusted
best friend walks in arm-in-arm with her boyfriend. The laughter stops abruptly, and the girl's
hand, holding the glass, freezes in mid-air, her smile captivated.

4-8 seconds: The best friend's expression becomes awkward upon seeing the girl. She tries to pull
her boyfriend to move to another seat, but he shakes her hand and walks straight to the girl,
placing a gift box in front of her and saying "Happy Birthday." The best friend's face turns pale.
The girl looks at her boyfriend, then at her best friend, finally focusing on their hands—the best
friend is wearing the same bracelet her boyfriend said he "lost" a few days ago.

9-12 seconds: The girl doesn't speak, but quietly picks up her glass and drinks it all in one gulp.
Then she stands up and walks to her best friend. Everyone holds their breath, waiting. The girl
smiles and slowly pours the wine onto her best friend's limited-edition bag. The best friend's eyes
widen, as if she's about to scream. The girl holds her shoulder;

13-15 seconds: The girl leans close to her best friend's ear and whispers, "Next time you're
cheating, remember to hide what you shouldn't show first." The best friend turns pale, and the girl
turns and leaves gracefully. The camera pulls back to show the best friend standing there stiffly,
her boyfriend full of regret, ending with a low background music and whispers around them.

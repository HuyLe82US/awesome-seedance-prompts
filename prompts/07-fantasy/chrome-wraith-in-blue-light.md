**Prompt:**

```text
A dark, fantastical female figure, with flowing long hair and an intricate metal crown topped with
sharp, antler-like points, her eyes closed, her expression serene, her pale skin softly glowing. Her
forearms and torso are transformed into smooth, black liquid metal with reflective chrome details,
and sharp, claw-like fingers extend from the darkness. Dramatic backlighting creates a halo effect
around her head, a cool blue-toned misty atmosphere, cinematic lighting, rich detail, surreal yet
elegant—a dark fantasy aesthetic.

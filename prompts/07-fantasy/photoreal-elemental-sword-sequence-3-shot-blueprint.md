**Prompt:**

```text
【Style】Hollywood Live-Action Blockbuster, IMAX movie quality, 8K ultra-high definition,
photorealistic cinematography, dark fantasy, Unreal Engine 5 realistic rendering, no anime feel.
【Duration】15 seconds 【Scene】A realistic misty forest under the moonlight, with damp soil and real
fallen leaves on the ground.

[00:00-00:05] Shot 1: Live-Action Performance - Water Breathing (Realistic Water FX). 【Close-up】An
Asian young swordsman (the pores on the actor's face are visible), wearing a green and black
checkered coarse cloth haori (the fabric texture is clear). Action: He holds his sword with both
hands under the moonlight, lowering his center of gravity. Special Effects: As he breathes, instead
of cartoonish water flow, **highly realistic, transparent, and luminous pressurized high-pressure
water flow (Hyper-realistic Fluid Simulation)** condenses on the blade. The water, like a living
dragon, coils around the realistic sword blade, water droplets splashing onto the lens and
refracting moonlight.

[00:05-00:10] Shot 2: Lightning Plasma. [Medium Shot/High-Speed ​​Photography] Opposite is a young
swordsman with dyed blond hair (real hair flowing), wearing a yellow triangular-patterned fabric
jacket. Action: He makes the starting stance for an iaido slash, the ground beneath his feet
cracking due to the excessive force. Effects: **Real, blinding blue-white electric currents (Real
Plasma Arcs)** erupt in the air, instead of yellow cartoon lightning. The current pierces through
the surrounding real trees, leaving scorched marks.

[00:10-00:15] Shot 3: Fated Showdown - Physics Clash. [Slow Motion/Big Explosion] The two collide at
high speed in the center of the frame. Action: The solid water giant sword collides violently with
the lightning blade. Effects: No comic book lines, only **real physical particle explosions**. Large
amounts of water vapor, mud, broken tree branches, and dazzling sparks flew through the air. The
shockwave created realistic ripples in the water beneath their feet. The scene was incredibly
powerful and destructive.
